I developed the frontend of this project with React. I created a server using NodeJs. I used MySql as database.
I used redux for state management.

## Step One

You must download Mamp to activate the database. https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/

## Step Two

You have to go to http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin and create a database named "obs".

## Step Three

You must enter the server file with the "cd server" command in the terminal. Then you have to run the "npm install" command. Later on
To start the server, you have to enter the "npm start" command in the terminal.

## Step Four

You should open a new terminal and enter the web file with the "cd web" command. Then you should run the "npm install" command. Then you have to run "npm start" command in terminal to start web side.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
